# Quantum Drone Path-Planning

This project is designed to develop a quantum algorithm for drone path-planning using Qiskit 2.0.

## Setup

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Start developing your quantum algorithm in the `main.py` file or create new modules as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Qiskit 2.0
